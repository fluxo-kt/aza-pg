## Why Archived?

These documents were moved to `.archived/` during Phase 2 documentation consolidation to:
1. Reduce duplication (60-70% overlap across 39+ markdown files)
2. Consolidate to 7 core docs + generated data
3. Prevent doc drift and stale information
4. Improve LLM context efficiency

## Current Documentation

See `/docs/INDEX.md` for the current documentation structure.
