# Archive

This directory previously contained historical audit reports, remediation summaries, and completed TODO checklists from 2025-01-07 through 2025-11-09.

**All removed** (2025-11-09) as they provided no future value:
- Audit reports documenting past code reviews
- TODO progress trackers for completed work
- Remediation summaries of historical fixes
- Verification reports of old changes

**Rationale:** These were logs of "what was done" not design decisions or technical rationale. All meaningful information is preserved in:
- Git commit history (granular changes)
- CHANGELOG.md (breaking changes, features, fixes)
- Current documentation (AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.)

**Future archiving policy:** Archive ONLY design decisions, rejected alternatives, or technical trade-offs with lasting value. Do NOT archive completed work logs, audit reports, or historical checklists.
