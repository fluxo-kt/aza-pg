# Squawk PostgreSQL Linter Configuration
# Tailored for aza-pg initialization scripts (not live database migrations)
#
# Context: Our SQL files are initialization scripts that run once on empty databases
# during container startup. They are NOT migrations on live databases with traffic.

# PostgreSQL version target
pg_version = "18.0"

# Exclude external/vendored SQL files (pgflow from @pgflow/core@0.7.2)
excluded_paths = [
  "**/05-pgflow.sql",
  "**/10-pgflow.sql",
  "examples/**/*.sql",
]

# Rules excluded because they don't apply to initialization scripts:
excluded_rules = [
  # CONCURRENT index creation is for live databases with traffic.
  # Our init scripts run on empty databases during startup - no traffic to block.
  "require-concurrent-index-creation",
  "require-concurrent-index-deletion",

  # BIGINT vs INT: Not all integers need 64-bit.
  # Retry counts, timeout seconds, etc. don't need BIGINT.
  # We'll use BIGINT only where it actually makes sense (IDs, large counts).
  "prefer-bigint-over-int",

  # NOT VALID constraints are for migrations on existing data.
  # Init scripts add constraints to empty tables - immediate validation is fine.
  "constraint-missing-not-valid",

  # Timeout settings are good practice for migrations but not critical for init scripts.
  # Init scripts are short-lived during container startup.
  "require-timeout-settings",
]

# We want robust, idempotent init scripts - keep these rules:
# - prefer-robust-stmts: Enforce IF NOT EXISTS for idempotency
# - prefer-identity: Use IDENTITY over deprecated SERIAL
# - adding-foreign-key-constraint: Evaluate FK warnings case-by-case
