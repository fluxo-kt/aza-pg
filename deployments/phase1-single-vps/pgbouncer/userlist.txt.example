# === INSTRUCTIONS ===
# This file contains PgBouncer authentication credentials in SCRAM-SHA-256 format.
#
# TO GENERATE:
# Run this command in PostgreSQL container after creating users:
#
#   docker exec postgres psql -U postgres -Atq -c \
#     "SELECT '\"' || usename || '\" \"' || passwd || '\"' FROM pg_shadow WHERE usename IN ('postgres', 'monitoring');" \
#     > pgbouncer/userlist.txt
#
# This will automatically extract hashed passwords from PostgreSQL and format them for PgBouncer.
#
# SECURITY:
# - This file contains password hashes (not plaintext)
# - Keep file permissions: chmod 600 userlist.txt
# - DO NOT commit this file to git (add to .gitignore)
# - Regenerate after password changes
#
# FORMAT:
# Each line: "username" "password_hash"
# Password can be:
# - SCRAM-SHA-256 hash (recommended, as shown above)
# - MD5 hash (legacy, not recommended)
# - Plaintext (DO NOT USE in production)
